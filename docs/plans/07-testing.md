# EPIC 07 — Comprehensive Testing Strategy

## Mission

Ensure reliability and quality of implemented functionality through comprehensive testing of all system components before developing new features. Establish regression protection and performance baselines for MVP.

## Why now

Before adding export system, quality assurance, and other advanced features, we need confidence in core functionality stability. Testing at this stage prevents technical debt accumulation and ensures safe progression to advanced features.

## Success Criteria

- Manual testing coverage 100% for all critical user journeys
- Automated test suite with focused coverage on core flows
- Performance baselines established for key endpoints
- Multi-tenant security isolation verified through automated tests
- Zero critical bugs in core authentication and document generation flows
- Testing framework ready for continuous development

## Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

### Performance SLOs

- **Authentication endpoints**: p95 response time ≤ 200ms
- **Project CRUD operations**: p95 response time ≤ 300ms
- **Document generation initiation**: p95 response time ≤ 500ms
- **SSE streaming latency**: ≤ 100ms for progress updates
- **Concurrent user handling**: Support 50+ concurrent tenants without degradation

### Reliability SLOs

- **Authentication success rate**: ≥ 99.9% for valid credentials
- **Multi-tenant isolation**: 0 cross-tenant data access violations
- **Token invalidation**: Immediate (≤ 1s) after logout
- **Database connection reliability**: ≥ 99.5% successful transactions

### Security SLOs

- **SQL injection protection**: 100% successful blockage of malicious inputs
- **CSRF protection**: 100% enforcement for state-changing operations
- **Rate limiting**: Effective throttling under load (≥ 100 req/min per user)
- **JWT validation**: 100% rejection of expired/invalid tokens

### Test Coverage SLOs

- **Unit test coverage**: ≥ 80% for core business logic
- **Integration test coverage**: 100% for authentication flows
- **E2E test coverage**: 100% for critical user journeys
- **Multi-tenant test scenarios**: 100% coverage of isolation scenarios
