# EPIC 09 — Observability & Monitoring

## Mission

Implement comprehensive observability system with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing, structured logging, metrics collection, and performance monitoring of all JEEX Plan system components.

## Why now

Observability is critical for production readiness of a multi-agent system. Without proper monitoring, it's impossible to debug issues in complex agent workflows, track performance bottlenecks, or ensure reliable service delivery.

## Success Criteria

- OpenTelemetry 1.27+ integrated with automatic instrumentation
- Distributed tracing works end-to-end through all components
- Structured logging with correlation IDs for all services
- Performance metrics collection and SLO monitoring
- Alert system for critical issues and SLA violations
- Monitoring dashboard for operational visibility

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Owner | Impact | Mitigation/Trigger |
|------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Observability overhead affecting performance | DevOps Engineer | Medium | Sampling strategies, performance benchmarking, configurable levels |
| Sensitive data leakage in traces/logs | Backend Developer | High | Data masking, field filtering, audit trails |
| Monitoring infrastructure complexity | DevOps Engineer | Medium | Managed services consideration, simplified deployment options |
| Alert fatigue from excessive notifications | DevOps Engineer | Low | Intelligent alert routing, escalation policies, noise reduction |
| Cost implications from extensive telemetry data | DevOps Engineer | Medium | Data retention policies, sampling optimization, cost monitoring |

## Acceptance Evidence

- Distributed traces are visible end-to-end for user request workflows
- Correlation IDs are present in all log entries
- Performance metrics are collected correctly for all key operations
- Alert system activates during simulated service failures
- Monitoring dashboards show accurate real-time data
- Observability does not negatively impact application performance
