# EPIC 08 — Quality Assurance & Content Validation

## Mission

Implement comprehensive quality assurance system for generated documents through automated validation, content scoring, consistency checks, and template compliance to achieve professional-grade output.

## Why now

Content quality is the key differentiator of JEEX Plan. Users must receive professional-level documents ready for business use. Validation is required on top of working document generation.

## Success Criteria

- Automated quality scoring for all generated documents (0-100 scale)
- Template compliance validation ensures structural consistency
- Cross-document consistency checks prevent contradictions
- Grammar and readability analysis integration
- Content completeness scoring with actionable feedback
- Quality gates block low-quality exports

## Stakeholders & Interfaces

- **Primary Owner**: Backend Developer
- **Reviewers**: Technical Writer, Product Manager
- **External Systems**: Language processing tools, Template engine

**External**: Grammar checking APIs, Readability analysis libraries

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Owner | Impact | Mitigation/Trigger |
|------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| False positives in grammar/style checking | Technical Writer | Medium | Tunable thresholds, domain-specific dictionaries, manual override |
| Performance impact on document generation | Backend Developer | Medium | Async validation, optional quality levels, caching |
| Quality scoring algorithm bias | Backend Developer | Medium | Multiple metrics combination, user feedback calibration |
| Language model quality limitations | Backend Developer | Low | Multiple validation approaches, human quality baselines |
| Overly strict quality gates blocking users | Product Manager | Medium | Gradual rollout, configurable thresholds, bypass options |

## Acceptance Evidence

- Quality scoring system generates consistent scores for test documents
- Template compliance validation catches structural issues reliably
- Cross-document consistency checks identify contradictions accurately
- Grammar and readability analysis provides actionable feedback
- Quality gates successfully block low-quality exports
- Quality metrics correlation with user satisfaction surveys
