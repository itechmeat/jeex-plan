function returns a hardcoded demo user; replace this placeholder with a real
FastAPI dependency that validates authentication and returns the authenticated
user's info, or explicitly raise an HTTPException (401 Unauthorized) or a 501
Not Implemented if auth is not yet available. Implement using FastAPI's Depends
to accept an auth token or API key (or plug into your existing auth backend),
validate the credential, extract and return user_id and tenant_id on success,
and ensure unauthorized or unimplemented paths raise the appropriate
HTTPException with a clear message.
